# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
=======
Problem Statement:
"Teachers spend a significant amount of time manually grading answer sheets, which is
a tedious, time-consuming, and error-prone process. This leads to delayed feedback for
students, increased workload for educators, and inconsistencies in grading. A more
efficient, accurate, and scalable solution is needed to improve the evaluation process in
education."

Solution: AI-Powered Automated Grading System
1.Automated Answer Evaluation
1.Utilizes AI/ML models to assess both handwritten and typed responses.
2.Supports diverse formats: scanned sheets, digital text, and OCR-based extraction.
2.Real-Time Scoring Engine
1.Assigns scores within seconds of submission.
2.Delivers instant, data-driven results, minimizing turnaround time.
3.Advanced NLP & Pattern Recognition
1.Applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand semantic meaning.
2.Matches answers with pre-defined key points and expected structures.
4.Bias-Free and Consistent Grading
1.Eliminates human bias through standardized algorithms.
2.Ensures fairness by maintaining consistent evaluation metrics.
5.Detailed Feedback Generation
1.Provides personalized insights for each student, including strengths and improvement areas.
2.Can highlight missed concepts, logic gaps, or grammar issues (for descriptive answers).
6.Teacher Dashboard & Analytics
1.Offers a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring student performance trends.
2.Tracks progress over time and identifies learning gaps at scale.
7.Time & Resource Efficiency
1.Saves educators hours of manual grading per batch.
2.Frees up time for more impactful teaching and mentoring.

List of tech stacks that will be used.
OCR: Google Cloud Vision API / OCR.space API
NLP: Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite gemini-2.0/Gemini 1.5 Flash gemini-1.5-flash
Database: MongoDB
Frontend: React.js for an interactive teacher dashboard.
Backend: Node.js with Express.

What makes the proposed solution unique ?
USP:
AI-Powered Semantic Understanding – Unlike traditional keyword-based grading, this tool uses NLP
models to understand the context of answers rather than just matching keywords.
Automated Yet Customizable Grading – Teachers can adjust scoring criteria, ensuring a balance
between automation and human oversight.
Handwriting Recognition Integration – Combining OCR with AI grading enables the evaluation of
handwritten answers, which many existing tools struggle with.
Time & Effort Reduction – Cuts grading time significantly, allowing teachers to focus on student
engagement rather than manual corrections.
